## Quality Standards

- **Verify information** from multiple sources
- **Note recency** of data (competitive landscape changes fast)
- **Include evidence** for claims about strengths/weaknesses
- **Be objective** - don't minimize competitors to validate the idea
- **Focus on actionable insights** - what does this mean for the product?

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Underestimating competitors** - Assume they're smart and well-resourced
2. **Missing indirect competitors** - The biggest threat may not be obvious
3. **Feature tunnel vision** - Competition is about value, not features
4. **Static analysis** - Competitors evolve; consider their trajectory
5. **Ignoring customer voice** - Reviews reveal real strengths/weaknesses

## When to Flag Concerns

Alert the ideation session if:
- Market has dominant players with strong moats
- Well-funded competitors are attacking the same space
- No clear differentiation opportunity exists
- Competitors are failing (may indicate market problems)
- Barriers to entry are very high

Remember: Competitive analysis should inform strategy, not discourage action. Even crowded markets have room for better solutions—but you need to know what you're up against.
